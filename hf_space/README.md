# Indoor Room ‚ûú 3D Model Space

This folder hosts a Hugging Face Space that recreates the TripoSG experience with an indoor-focused twist. Upload multi-view photographs of a room and the app will recover a structured COLMAP reconstruction, optionally delegating to a VGGT PointMap command for depth-guided fusion. The output bundle includes the sparse model, dense point clouds, and any mesh generated by your VGGT command.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app.py` | Gradio application for COLMAP-based indoor reconstruction with optional VGGT depth fusion. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies installed by the Space runtime. |
| `packages.txt` | `apt` packages Hugging Face installs before pip dependencies (COLMAP prerequisites). |
| `assets/demo.zip` | Drop a miniature dataset here for automated smoke tests (optional). |

## Running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv               # optional but recommended
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the interface
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:7860 to access the Gradio UI. Override `HF3D_OUTPUT_ROOT` to choose where run artifacts are stored. Set `VGGT_ROOM_COMMAND` to point at a custom VGGT/PointMap executable if you want depth fusion to run automatically. The command receives helpful environment variables (`VGGT_INPUT_IMAGES`, `VGGT_INPUT_DEPTH`, `VGGT_INPUT_CAMERAS`, `VGGT_WORKSPACE`, `VGGT_MAX_RESOLUTION`).

## Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces

1. Create a new Space with the **Gradio** SDK and GPU hardware.
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the Space repository (or set it as a Git submodule).
3. Enable persistent storage to cache COLMAP databases, fused point clouds, and VGGT meshes.
4. If your VGGT command requires additional system packages, add them to `packages.txt`/`requirements.txt` and rebuild the Space.

COLMAP already ships with the Space via `packages.txt`. VGGT integration is intentionally pluggable so you can wire in any of the suggested indoor models (VGGT PointMap, Fast3R, 3D-R1, etc.).
